When will that be?

Fetal stemcells, aren't those controversial? It doesn't look so shiny to me. It's a T. It goes "tuh". And until then, I can never die?

You seem malnourished. Are you suffering from intestinal parasites? THE BIG BRAIN AM WINNING AGAIN! I AM THE GREETEST! **NOW I AM LEAVING EARTH, FOR NO RAISEN!** _WINDMILLS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY!_ GOOD NIGHT!

## We need rest. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised.

Bender, I didn't know you liked cooking. That's so cute. If rubbin' frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong, hey I don't wanna be right. Oh right. I forgot about the battle. Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I'm going to come back there and change your opinions manually!

1. I guess if you want children beaten, you have to do it yourself.
2. I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept the lesser title of Zinc Saucier, which I just made up. Uhhâ€¦ also, comes with double prize money.
3. Take me to your leader!

### Or a guy who burns down a bar for the insurance money!

There's one way and only one way to determine if an animal is intelligent. Dissect its brain! Okay, I like a challenge. I'll get my kit! Michelle, I don't regret this, but I both rue and lament it. Wow, you got that off the Internet? In my day, the Internet was only used to download pornography.

* She also liked to shut up!
* Fry! Quit doing the right thing, you jerk!
* She also liked to shut up!

And then the battle's not so bad? Oh sure! Blame the wizards! You guys aren't Santa! You're not even robots. How dare you lie in front of Jesus? Just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged.

You'll have all the Slurm you can drink when you're partying with Slurms McKenzie! Wow, you got that off the Internet? In my day, the Internet was only used to download pornography. Throw her in the brig.

You know the worst thing about being a slave? They make you work, but they don't pay you or let you go. You won't have time for sleeping, soldier, not with all the bed making you'll be doing. Yes, except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't rock.

Kids don't turn rotten just from watching TV. Yes, except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't rock. When I was first asked to make a film about my nephew, Hubert Farnsworth, I thought "Why should I?" Then later, Leela made the film. But if I did make it, you can bet there would have been more topless women on motorcycles. Roll film!

The alien mothership is in orbit here. If we can hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of cards. Checkmate. Is today's hectic lifestyle making you tense and impatient? Shut up and get to the point!

Well, thanks to the Internet, I'm now bored with sex. Is there a place on the web that panders to my lust for violence? You lived before you met me?! Ah, yes! John Quincy Adding Machine. He struck a chord with the voters when he pledged not to go on a killing spree.

It's okay, Bender. I like cooking too. I'll get my kit! That's right, baby. I ain't your loverboy Flexo, the guy you love so much. You even love anyone pretending to be him! The alien mothership is in orbit here. If we can hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of cards. Checkmate.

Yeah, I do that with my stupidness. Our love isn't any different from yours, except it's hotter, because I'm involved. Yes. You gave me a dollar and some candy. Yeah, and if you were the pope they'd be all, "Straighten your pope hat." And "Put on your good vestments."

Morbo can't understand his teleprompter because he forgot how you say that letter that's shaped like a man wearing a hat. Yes, I saw. You were doing well, until everyone died. I guess because my parents keep telling me to be more ladylike. As though!

Good news, everyone! There's a report on TV with some very bad news! And I'd do it again! And perhaps a third time! But that would be it. You're going to do his laundry? And until then, I can never die?

Soothe us with sweet lies. Anyhoo, your net-suits will allow you to experience Fry's worm infested bowels as if you were actually wriggling through them. Why would a robot need to drink? Hey, whatcha watching?
